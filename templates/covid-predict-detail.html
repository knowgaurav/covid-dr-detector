                <h2>Project Brief:</h2>
                <p>COVID-19 is an acronym for coronavirus disease 2019 or SARS-coronavirus-2 which was first discovered
                    in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Since then, it has been rapidly spreading all over the world and
                    infecting not only humans but other animals too with ACE2 receptors in their lungs. Even though the
                    fatality rate of COVID-19 is lower than previous coronavirus diseases like MERS or SARS, the
                    transmissibility rate is far higher. This makes early detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 crucial to
                    limit the spread from infected people. It also helps in the treatment and management of infected
                    individuals. Developing countries with much of their population living in villages like India and
                    Brazil have been affected far greater than developed countries with adequate healthcare
                    infrastructure for diagnosis and treatment.
                </p>
                <p>To tackle this problem, and to assist in the detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 in the underserved
                    parts of the world, we have come up with an image classification model using deep learning which can
                    detect COVID-19 from the Chest X-Ray scans with reasonably high accuracy (>95%). This model when
                    deployed in areas where healthcare infrastructure is not up to the mark and testing is in limited
                    numbers, can help to make X-Ray scans another alternative in the fight against COVID-19. </p>
